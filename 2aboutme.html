		<h2>AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h2>
		<p>Born in Quezon City, Metro Manila, then ending up in the City of Ilagan, Isabela, I am Kate Danielle R. Alcayde, 18 years old but with the joints and back of someone in their late 40s. Starting from elemnetary, I've been... well... let's just say a bit intellectually lacking. it continued that way until the last year of junior high. And now? top it's as if I've been reborn. I'm not quite sure what caused it but I think half of it would be credited to my sudden love of coding and developing games. it started from brick coding back in high school and some beginner level game development. Even before that, I've always loved to create. mini roleplays, short stories, character desings, my world has always been about creativity, and I guess that became the biggest driving force that led me to taking a Bachelor's of Science in Information Technology and majoring in web and mobile app development. Actually, I was supposed to take entertainment and multimedia computing in Cauayan but I was eventually persuaded into enrolling into the IT program of Ilagan by my old teacher back in my last year of Senior High. Now I'm right where I'm meant to be... or maybe not... but time will tell. For now, however, I feel that this is right for me.</p>
